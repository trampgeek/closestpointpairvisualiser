# closestpointpairvisualiser
A visualiser for the line-sweep algorithm for the closest point pair problem.
Lets the user load up a point set, or use a preloaded one, and step the algorithm
through its various stages by clicking a button. A 'Back' button is also available, plus
a slider for large scale steps.

To see it in action, either download it and open `closestpointpair.html` in the browser, or just visit
[this demo site](https://lobb.nz/closestpointpairvisualiser/closestpointpair.html).
